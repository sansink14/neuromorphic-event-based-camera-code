typical free space loss is 20 dB (for a point to point system)  -- if we can still detect/communicate with a lower loss than we do better than a typical point to point.

Atmospheric loss
This may cause polarization fluctuations, beam steering, image dancing, beam spreading and scintillation. Scintillation causes the amplitude of the received signal to fluctuate rapidly by as much as 30 dB with power spectral density spanning 0.01â€“200 Hz, and hence give rise to long bursts of data errors.
